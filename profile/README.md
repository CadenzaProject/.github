This is the GitHub Organisation for the Cadenza project. Cadenza is a UK-funded project that is working with the music, hearing and machine learning communities to set up machine learning challenges for furthering the development of hearing aid signal processing algorithms.

For further information about the project please visit the [Cadenza project website](http://cadenzachallenge.org/).

Most repositories below are private and intended for use by project members (e.g., websites, development tools etc). 

The project will be publishing tools via the [`PyClarity`](https://github.com/claritychallenge/clarity) software; open-source tools that are being provided to support our community challenges.
